# docker-cgit

This is a docker compose for running cgit with uWSGI on Alpine fronted by NGINX.

[cgit][0] is a hyperfast web frontend for git repositories written in C by Jason
Donenfeld and contributors.

This is pretty much an updated version of work by [Sergiy Kulanov][1] that
replaces Debian "Jessie" as the Docker image base with cgit on Alpine Linux.
Thanks, Sergiy.
